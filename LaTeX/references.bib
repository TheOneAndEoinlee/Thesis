   abstract = {Recent advances in multistable metamaterials reveal a link between structural configuration transition and Boolean logic, heralding a new generation of computationally capable intelligent materials. To enable higher-level computation, existing computational frameworks require the integration of large-scale networked logic gates, which places demanding requirements on the fabrication of materials counterparts and the propagation of signals. Inspired by cellular automata, we propose a novel computational framework based on multistable origami metamaterials by incorporating reservoir computing, which can accomplish high-level computation tasks without the need to construct a logic gate network. This approach thus eleimates the demanding requirements for fabrication of materials and signal propagation when constructing large-scale networks for high-level computation in conventional mechano-logic. Using the multistable stacked Miura-origami metamaterial as a validation platform, digit recognition is successfully implemented through experiments by a single actuator. Moreover, complex tasks, such as handwriting recognition and 5-bit memory tasks, are also shown to be feasible with the new computation framework. Our research represents a significant advancement in developing a new generation of intelligent materials with advanced computational capabilities. With continued research and development, these materials could have a transformative impact on a wide range of fields, from computational science to material mechano-intelligence technology and beyond.},

   abstract = {Mechanical computing requires matter to adapt behavior according to retained knowledge, often through integrated sensing, actuation, and control of deformation. However, inefficient access to mechanical memory and signal propagation limit mechanical computing modules. To overcome this, we developed an in-memory mechanical computing architecture where computing occurs within the interaction network of mechanical memory units. Interactions embedded within data read-write interfaces provided function-complete and neuromorphic computing while reducing data traffic and simplifying data exchange. A reprogrammable mechanical binary neural network and a mechanical self-learning perceptron were demonstrated experimentally in 3D printed mechanical computers, as were all 16 logic gates and truth-table entries that are possible with two inputs and one output. The in-memory mechanical computing architecture enables the design and fabrication of intelligent mechanical systems. Here, Mei and Chen propose an in-memory mechanical computing architecture with simplified and reduced data exchange, where computing occurs within mechanical memory units, to facilitate the design of intelligent mechanical systems.},

By mapping a Boolean local Rule, or truth table, onto the point attractors of a specially tailored nonlinear dynamical system, we show how some of Wolfram's empirical observations can be justified on firm ground. The advantage of this new approach for studying Cellular Automata phenomena is that it is based on concepts from nonlinear dynamics and attractors where many fuzzy concepts introduced by Wolfram via brute force observations can be defined and justified via mathematical analysis. The main result of Part I is the introduction of a fundamental concept called linear separability and a complexity index κ for each local Rule which characterizes the intrinsic geometrical structure of an induced "Boolean cube" in three-dimensional Euclidean space. In particular, Wolfram's seductive idea of a "threshold of complexity" is identified with the class of local Rules having a complexity index equal to 2.},

   abstract = {This work introduces the concept of applying binary-stiffness beams within a lattice to achieve a mechanical neural-network (MNN) metamaterial that learns its behaviors and properties with prolonged exposure to unanticipated ambient loading scenarios. Applying such beams to MMN metamaterials greatly increases their learning speed and simplifies the actuation demands, control circuitry, and optimization algorithms required by previously proposed concepts. A binary-stiffness beam design is proposed that uses principles of constraint manipulation and stiffness cancelation to achieve two switchable and discrete states of stiffness (i.e., binary stiffness) along its axis. The beam achieves a near-zero low-stiffness state and a large difference in stiffness between its high and low-stiffness states, which are both shown to be desirable attributes for learning mechanical behaviors. Simulations are conducted to characterize the effect of lattice size, the difference in stiffness between the constituent beam’s high and low-stiffness states, the magnitude of its low-stiffness state, and the number of simultaneously learned behaviors on MNN learning using binary-stiffness beams. Thus, this work provides a necessary step toward enabling practical artificial intelligent (AI) metamaterials.},

   abstract = {The ratio of in-plane stiffness to out-of-plane bending stiffness of graphene is shown to be similar to that of a piece of paper, which allows ideas from kirigami (a variation of origami that allows cutting) to be applied to micrometre-scale graphene sheets to build mechanically stretchable yet robust electrodes, springs and hinges. The paper arts of origami and kirigami (which allows cutting as well as folding) are scalable, and increasingly used by scientists and engineers to create structures from the macro- to the microscale. Melina Blees and colleagues now show that graphene is well suited for kirigami: its relative stiffness against in-plane stretching as opposed to out-of-plane bending is similar to that of a piece of paper, owing to the presence of ripples that stiffen the graphene sheets and dramatically increase their bending stiffness over the predicted atomic-scale value. Ideas from kirigami can thus be applied quite readily to micrometre-sized graphene sheets, and used to build mechanically stretchable yet robust electrodes, springs and hinges that could find use in atomically thin membrane devices for sensing, manipulation, and possibly even robotics applications. For centuries, practitioners of origami (‘ori’, fold; ‘kami’, paper) and kirigami (‘kiru’, cut) have fashioned sheets of paper into beautiful and complex three-dimensional structures. Both techniques are scalable, and scientists and engineers are adapting them to different two-dimensional starting materials to create structures from the macro- to the microscale1,2. Here we show that graphene3,4,5,6 is well suited for kirigami, allowing us to build robust microscale structures with tunable mechanical properties. The material parameter crucial for kirigami is the Föppl–von Kármán number7,8 γ: an indication of the ratio between in-plane stiffness and out-of-plane bending stiffness, with high numbers corresponding to membranes that more easily bend and crumple than they stretch and shear. To determine γ, we measure the bending stiffness of graphene monolayers that are 10–100 micrometres in size and obtain a value that is thousands of times higher than the predicted atomic-scale bending stiffness. Interferometric imaging attributes this finding to ripples in the membrane9,10,11,12,13 that stiffen the graphene sheets considerably, to the extent that γ is comparable to that of a standard piece of paper. We may therefore apply ideas from kirigami to graphene sheets to build mechanical metamaterials such as stretchable electrodes, springs, and hinges. These results establish graphene kirigami as a simple yet powerful and customizable approach for fashioning one-atom-thick graphene sheets into resilient and movable parts with microscale dimensions.},

The synthesis approaches are described and illustrated by several design examples. Compound use of both approaches is also discussed. The design potential of the synthesis approaches is demonstrated by the successful operation of several instantiations of designs that exhibit three, four, five, and nine stable equilibrium positions, respectively.

   abstract = {Physical systems exhibiting neuromechanical functions promise to enable structures with directly encoded autonomy and intelligence. We report on a class of neuromorphic metamaterials embodying bioinspired mechanosensing, memory, and learning functionalities obtained by leveraging mechanical instabilities and flexible memristive materials. Our prototype system comprises a multistable metamaterial whose bistable units filter, amplify, and transduce external mechanical inputs over large areas into simple electrical signals using piezoresistivity. We record these mechanically transduced signals using non-volatile flexible memristors that remember sequences of mechanical inputs, providing a means to store spatially distributed mechanical signals in measurable material states. The accumulated memristance changes resulting from the sequential mechanical inputs allow us to physically encode a Hopfield network into our neuromorphic metamaterials. This physical network learns a series of external spatially distributed input patterns. Crucially, the learned patterns input into our neuromorphic metamaterials can be retrieved from the final accumulated state of our memristors. Therefore, our system exhibits the ability to learn without supervised training and retain spatially distributed inputs with minimal external overhead. Our system's embodied mechanosensing, memory, and learning capabilities establish an avenue for synthetic neuromorphic metamaterials enabling the learning of touch-like sensations covering large areas for robotics, autonomous systems, wearables, and morphing structures.},

By introducing magnetic forces and coupling them with two cone dielectric elastomer (DE) films, an inherent tristability for the DEA is obtained with a compact design. It is easy to switch between the three stable states by controlling the voltages applied to the DE films. A theoretical model of the system's potential energy that contains the free energy of the DEs and the potential energy of the applied magnetic field was developed for the tristable mechanism. The experimental results demonstrate that controllable transitions between the three stable states can be achieved with this design by applying over-critical voltages to the various DE films. The maximum dynamic range of the DEA can exceed 53.8% of the total length of the device and the DE's creep speed was accelerated under the action of the magnetic field.},

Scalable, tristable structural elements that can be built up to form mechanical metamaterials with an extremely large number of programmable stable configurations remains illusive. Here, we harness the elastic tensile/ compressive asymmetry of kirigami microstructures to design a class of scalable X-shaped tristable structures. Using these structure as building block elements, hierarchical mechanical metamaterials with one-dimensional (1D) cylindrical geometries, 2D square lattices, and 3D cubic/octahedral lattices are designed and demonstrated, with capabilities of torsional multistability or independent controlled multidirectional multistability.

   abstract = {We create mechanical metamaterials whose response to uniaxial compression can be programmed by lateral confinement, allowing monotonic, non-monotonic and hysteretic behavior. These func-tionalities arise from a broken rotational symmetry which causes highly nonlinear coupling of deformations along the two primary axes of these metamaterials. We introduce a soft mechanism model which captures the programmable mechanics, and outline a general design strategy for confined mechanical metamaterials. Finally, we show how inhomogeneous confinement can be explored to create multi stability and giant hysteresis. PACS numbers: 81.05.Zx, 46.70.De, 62.20.mq, 81.05.Xj Metamaterials derive their unusual properties from their structure, rather than from their composition [1]. Important examples of mechanical metamaterials are auxetic (negative Poisson's ratio) materials [2], materials with vanishing shear modulus [3-5], materials with negative compressibility [6, 7], singularly nonlinear materials [8, 9] and topological metamaterials [10-12]. Of particular recent interest are mechanical metamaterials whose functionality relies on elastic instabilities, such as quasi 2D slabs perforated with a square array of holes [13-17]. When compressed, these "holey sheets" undergo a buckling-like pattern transformation, which can be explored to obtain switchable auxetics [15], chi-ral and phononic properties [18-20], and 3D "buckley balls" [21, 22]. An important limitation common to all these metamaterials is that each mechanical functionality requires a different structure. Here we present a novel strategy to create pro-grammable mechanical metamaterials, where the response of a single structure is determined by confinement. The core idea is illustrated in Fig. 1 for a biholar sheet, a quasi-2D elastic slab of material patterned by a regular array of large and small holes. The difference in hole sizes breaks one of the 90 • rotation symmetries which is present for equal hole sizes. This causes a difference in the polarization of the hole pattern, depending on whether x-compression or y-compression is dominant-see Fig. 1c-d [23]. By constraining this metamaterial in the x-direction, and then compressing it in the y-direction, the material undergoes a pattern switch from a x-polarized to a y-polarized state, as illustrated in Fig. 1c-d. Depending on the magnitude of the x-confinement, this pattern switch can be either smooth or discontinuous, and the force-displacement curves for the y-deformations can be tuned from monotonic to non-monotonic (unstable) to hysteretic-all for a single biholar sheet. We observe this tunability in experiments on systems of various sizes as well as in numerical simulations of the unit cell-this is a robust phenomenon. We introduce d) x-polarized y-polarized D 1 D 2 p x y c) b) a) FIG. 1: (Color online) (a-b) A biholar sheet characterized by hole diameters D1 = 10 mm, D2 = 7 mm and pitch p = 10 mm. (c) Uniform confinement in the x-direction (by semi-transparent clamps) leads to an x-polarization of the material. (d) Sufficient y-compression of this x-confined material leads to a switch of the polarization, and concomittant non-trivial mechanical behavior. a simple model that qualitatively captures all these different mechanical behaviors, and which allows a precise study of the bifurcation scenario that underlies this phe-nomenology. Finally, we show that the sensitive nature of the hysteretic switching between x and y-polarized patterns can be explored in larger systems, where controlled inhomogeneities lead to multi-stability and giant hystere-sis. We suggest that confinement is a general mechanism for a much larger class of programmable mechanical metamaterials, and outline how our model opens a pathway towards rational design of these materials.

   abstract = {Many plants autonomously change morphology and function in response to environmental stimuli or sequences of stimuli. In contrast with the electronically-integrated sensors, actuators, and microprocessors in traditional mechatronic systems, natural systems embody these sensing, actuation, and control functions within their compositional and structural features. Inspired by nature, we embody logic in autonomous systems to enable them to respond to multiple stimuli. Using 3D printable fibrous composites, we fabricate structures with geometries near bifurcation points associated with a transition between bistability and monostability. When suitable stimuli are present, the materials swell anisotropically. This forces a key geometric parameter to pass through a bifurcation, triggering rapid and large-amplitude self-actuation. The actuation time can be programmed by varying structural parameters (from 0.6 to 108 s for millimeter-scale structures). We demonstrate this bioinspired control strategy with examples that respond to their environment according to their embodied logic, without electronics, external control, or tethering. The demonstration of nature-inspired embodied control logic in simple autonomous material systems is of significant interest in applications such as soft robots and drug delivery. Here, the authors demonstrate 3D printed self-actuating structures with control logic in response to suitable stimuli.},

Using direct ink writing, [ 12 ] an extrusion-based 3D printing method, we rapidly fabricate customized energy-absorbing architectures. Their design, which is inspired by the exotic response of bistable elastic elements, [ 13-18 ] is guided by numerical fi nite element (FE) simulations. Importantly, the energy-trapping mechanism depends solely on the (reversible) change in state of prescribed structural geometries. Hence, the mechanical response is reversible and repeatable, and independent of scale, rate, and loading history. Remarkably, these architected materials reduce the peak acceleration and forces experienced during impact by an order of magnitude compared to previously proposed mechanisms that exploit only snap-through instabilities. [ 10 ] To illustrate the proposed mechanism, we consider an elastic constrained tilted beam. In contrast to a vertical elastic beam that buckles under axial compression, but fully recovers its initial shape when unloaded (Figure 1 a), a tilted beam may snap between two different stable confi gurations [ 19-22 ] and retain its deformed shape after unloading (Figure 1 b). Interestingly, such a bistable tilted beam is capable of locking in most of the energy inserted into the system during loading (quantifi ed by the shaded area under the corresponding force-displacement curve), indicating that it can be used as an energy absorbing element. To create energy trapping architected materials that exploit the bistability of tilted elastic beams, it is necessary to accurately control structural features. Direct ink writing offers a facile method for rapidly fabricating materials composed of arrays of tilted elastic beams in programmable motifs. With this 3D printing technique, viscoelastic inks are extruded through fi ne deposition nozzles in a layer-by-layer manner. [ 23-25 ] The inks exhibit shear-thinning behavior, which facilitates their fl ow through the nozzle during printing, as well as a shear elastic modulus that ensures that the printed features are self-supporting. Specifi cally, we used a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) ink to print energy-trapping, architected materials (Figures S1 and S2, Supporting Information). This silicone-based ink maintains its structural integrity prior to cross-linking the printed structures at 100 °C for 30 min to yield an elastomeric material with an initial shear modulus µ 0 = 0.32 MPa (Figure S3, Supporting Information). We note that direct ink writing is particularly well-suited to our beam-based geometries, since narrow features with tunable aspect ratios can be readily fabricated by locally varying the print velocity. Additionally, certain common defects, such as poorly connected nodes, are prevented by printing a structure from one continuous fi lament. We combine 3D printing and numerical analysis to design a new class of architected materials that exhibits controlled trapping of elastic energy. These programmed structures contain beam elements with geometries that are specifi cally designed to enable large, local bistable deformations. When these materials are mechanically deformed, the beams locally reconfi gure into a higher-energy, yet stable, deformed state, akin to a phase transformation. The energy applied during deformation, whether via low rate quasistatic loading or via impact tests, can be stored in this manner until a suffi cient reverse force is applied that allows the deformed beams to return to their original confi gu-ration. The mechanism of energy absorption stems solely from the structural geometry of the printed beam elements, and is therefore both materials-and loading rate-independent. These architected materials offer a new strategy for signifi cantly enhancing energy absorption. Energy-absorbing materials are widely deployed for personnel protection, crash mitigation in automobiles and aircraft, and protective packaging of delicate components. Many strategies have been investigated to create materials that effi ciently dissipate mechanical energy, including plastic deformation in metals, [ 1-4 ] fragmentation in ceramics, [ 5 ] and rate-dependent viscous processes. [ 1,6,7 ] However, in all of these systems there are challenges associated with either reusability or rate dependency. Most recently, mechanical metamaterials have been fabricated in novel geometries to realize recoverable energy-absorbing behavior in elastic systems, [ 8-11 ] suggesting novel strategies for mechanical dissipation of energy.},

   abstract = {Combinatorial problems arising in puzzles, origami, and (meta)material design have rare sets of solutions, which define complex and sharply delineated boundaries in configuration space. These boundaries are difficult to capture with conventional statistical and numerical methods. Here we show that convolutional neural networks can learn to recognize these boundaries for combinato-rial mechanical metamaterials, down to finest detail, despite using heavily undersampled training sets, and can successfully generalize. This suggests that the network infers the underlying com-binatorial rules from the sparse training set, opening up new possibilities for complex design of (meta)materials. From proteins and magnets to metamaterials, all around us systems with emergent properties are made from collections of interacting building blocks. Classifying such systems-do they fold, are they magnetized, do they have a target property-normally involves calculating these properties from their structure. This is often straightforward in principle, yet computationally expensive in practice, e.g. requiring the diagonalization of large matrices. Machine learning algorithms such as neural networks (NNs) forgo the need for such calculations by "learning" the classification of structures. In particular, machine learning has proven successful to find patterns in crumpling [1], active matter [2-4] and hydrodynamics [5], photonics [6-8], predict structural defects and plasticity [9, 10], design metamaterials [11-18], determine order parameters [19-26], identify phase transitions [27-44] , and predict protein structure [45]. In these examples, the relevant property typically varies smoothly and there is no sharp boundary separating classes in configuration space. NNs are thought to be successful because they interpolate these blurred boundaries, even when the configuration space is heavily undersampled. In contrast, combinatorial problems, viz. those where building blocks have to fit together as in a jigsaw puzzle, feature a sharp boundary between compatible (C) and incompatible (I) configurations. Such problems arise in self-assembly [47, 48], folding [49, 50], tiling problems [51] and combinatorial mechanical metamaterials [46, 52-54]. The latter are created by tiling different unit cells and are restricted by kinematic compatibility. A simple example is that of structures that can be either floppy (zero mode) or frustrated (no zero mode) (Fig. 1(a, b)). The floppy structures require a specific arrangement of building blocks where all the deformations fit together compatibly (C), and therefore are rare and very sensitive to small perturbations. These perturbations are likely to induce frustrated incompatible (I) configurations (Fig. 1(b)). The space of C designs can be pictured as needles in a haystack (Fig. 1(c, d)) and crucially is determined by a set of implicit combinatorial rules. Unless we know these rules, these problems are typically com-putationally intractable. (c) (a) (b) (d) Figure 1. (color online) (a) The building block of [46] can be tiled in two orientations (left) that have a distinct deformation in two dimensions (right). (b) The building blocks of (a) combine into larger designs (structures) that are either C (top) or I (bottom). A change of a single building block can frustrate the deformation (red circle) and change the structure from one that hosts a zero mode (a deformation that costs no energy) (C) to one that does not host a zero mode (I). A set of rules can be formulated for a unit cell design to have a zero mode [46]. (c, d) Conceptual configuration spaces of a discrete combinatorial metamaterial problem.

However, the highly dissipative nature of soft materials intrinsically limits or prevents certain functions, such as the propagation of mechanical signals. Here we present an architected soft system composed of elastomeric bistable beam elements connected by elastomeric linear springs. The dissipative nature of the polymer readily damps linear waves, preventing propagation of any mechanical signal beyond a short distance, as expected. However, the unique architecture of the system enables propagation of stable, nonlinear solitary transition waves with constant, controllable velocity and pulse geometry over arbitrary distances. Because the high damping of the material removes all other linear, small-amplitude excitations, the desired pulse propagates with high fidelity and controllability. This phenomenon can be used to control signals, as demonstrated by the design of soft mechanical diodes and logic gates.},

   abstract = {Mechanical computing has seen resurgent interest recently owing to the potential to embed sensing and computation into new classes of programmable metamaterials. To realize this, however, one must push signals from one part of a device to another, and do so in a way that can be reset robustly. We investigate the propagation of signals in a bistable mechanical cascade uphill in energy. By identifying a penetration length for perturbations, we show that signals can propagate uphill for finite distances and map out parameters for this to occur. Experiments on soft elastomers corroborate our results. Mechanical devices that compute have apparently existed for thousands of years [1], yet have fallen out of favor since the advent of the modern electronic computer. However, the recent interest in mechanical metamaterials has led to a resurgence of interest in new forms of mechanical computing using modern-and predominantly soft-materials [2, 3], resulting in demonstrations of stable memory [4], boolean logic [5-11], and pattern recognition [12] among other computational and logical tasks. The dream is to create materials that change their behavior based on simple logic in response to external stimuli. To achieve that, in addition to logical elements, one requires convenient methods to transmit signals from one part of a material to another and a way to reset the state of a device or signal. Recent work has demonstrated devices that can propagate mechanical signals by taking advantage of a series of interacting bistable elements of varying design [13-20]. Previous work has shown that for asymmetric bistable units, transitioning from a higher to lower energy state allows for propagation over arbitrarily long distances [21-24]. When utilizing symmetric bistable units, a decreasing grading of the interaction energy between bistable elements [25] or the energy barrier of the element itself [26] allows for stable propagation. Specifically designed bistable elements [26] or active components [27] can produce reversible signal propagation. In this paper, we focus on a horizontal chain of bistable units (Fig. 1(b)) which act as relays that can each be in either a "left" (no signal) or "right" (signal) state [19, 24]. In order to perform multiple computations using chains with these bistable elements, we will need the ability to reset our system by sending a signal in both directions along the chain, indicating that it is important to also understand whether signals can propagate along uniform chains with no bias or a bias infavor of the "left" state. To further explore this signaling cascade and gain insight into how many mechanical computations can really be performed using coupled, bistable elements, we consider this problem for finite chains of bistable elements as a function of both the difference in minimum energies , ∆, and barrier height E (Fig. 1(b)). Specifically, we look at the cases where the potential is symmetric V(x) x = − d +x x Δ E h θ 2 (a) (b) x = 0 FIG. 1. (a) The general shape of a bistable potential. The black line represents a symmetric potential with barrier height E. The blue line represents an asymmetric potential biased to the left where ∆ is the potential difference between the two states. We measure the barrier height E with respect to the higher minimum. (b) An elastic bistable unit at equilibrium. The linear springs each have stiffness k. The torsional spring located at the point mass m (filled black circle) has torsional modulus s and equilibrium angle θ0. The potential minima for the bistable unit are located at x = ±d. The potential barrier is located at x = 0. and favors neither state, and cases where the potential favors the "left" state. Since we imagine working primarily with soft materials, we focus on the overdamped limit. This provides us with a set of simple scaling laws governing when signals propagate in terms of the number of elements and the energy of the bistable elements and provides limits on the number of computations that could be conceivably performed and reset.},

   abstract = {Multistable mechanical metamaterials are materials that have multiple stable configurations. The geometrical changes caused by the transition of the metamaterial from one stable state to another, could be exploited to obtain multifunctional and programmable materials. As the stimulus amplitude is varied, a multistable metamaterial goes through a sequence of stable configurations. However, this sequence (which we will call the deformation sequence) is unpredictable if the metamaterial consists of identical unit cells. This paper proposes to use small variations in the unit cell geometry to obtain a deterministic deformation sequence for one type of multistable metamaterial that consists of bistable unit cells. Based on an analytical model for a single unit cell and on the minimization of the total strain energy, a rigorous theoretical model is proposed to analyze the nonlinear mechanics of this type of metamaterials and to inform the designs. The proposed theoretical model is able to accurately predict the deformation sequence and the stress strain curves that are observed in the finite-element simulations with an elastic constitutive model. A deterministic deformation sequence that matches the sequence predicted by the theory and finite-element simulations is obtained in experiments with 3D-printed samples. Furthermore, an excellent quantitative agreement between simulations and experiments is obtained once a viscoelastic constitutive model is introduced in the finite-element model.},

These attempts will enable mechanical systems to perform intelligent tasks, such as sensing the environment, changing geometries, making decisions, and executing computation in an even more proactive and autonomous manner, as compared to traditional mechatronic systems. However, there is no systematic foundation in constructing and integrating different aspects of mechano-intelligence. To advance the state of art, this research proposes to enhance the mechano-intelligence in adaptive structures through a machine learning framework called Physical Reservoir Computing (PRC). We show that a tunable modular metastructure can learn from its own wave dynamics and adaptively tune its own band structure via PRC. In other words, the metastructure can sense different input waves, make decisions and output appropriate control commands to alter its own wave characteristics without digital signal processors and controllers, i.e., achieve autonomous and integrated mechano-intelligence. Overall, this research provides a novel method to achieve intelligent and adaptive vibration/wave control based on the concepts of physical computing and learning and forms the basis for multi-faceted functional-relevant mechano-intelligence to be embedded in future adaptive structures and material systems.},

   abstract = {Multi-material 3D printing has created new opportunities for fabricating deployable structures. We design reversible, deployable structures that are fabricated flat, have defined load bearing capacity, and multiple, predictable activated geometries. These structures are designed with a hierarchical framework where the proposed bistable actuator serves as the base building block. The actuator is designed to maximise its stroke length, with the expansion ratio approaching one when serially connected. The activation force of the actuator is parameterised through its joint material and joint length. Simulation and experimental results show that the bistability triggering force can be tuned between 0.5 and 5.0 N. Incorporating this bistable actuator, the first group of hierarchical designs demonstrate the deployment of space frame structures with a tetrahedron module consisting of three active edges, each containing four serially connected actuators. The second group shows the design of flat structures that assume either positive or negative Gaussian curvature once activated. By flipping the initial configuration of the unit actuators, structures such as a dome and an enclosure are demonstrated. A modified Dynamic Relaxation method is used to simulate all possible geometries of the hierarchical structures. Measured geometries differ by less than 5% compared to simulation results. An active or smart structure initiates state or function changes to respond to external stimuli. Such behaviours are observed both in nature and in human-made artifacts. Mechanically active structures have seen applications that largely fall into two categories: deployment and energy absorption. Deployment involves transforming a device between desired states; common applications are in robotics 1 and morphing structures 2. Energy absorption and propagation is a newly investigated field where an active structure deforms predictably under impact and either absorbs or transmits kinetic energy 3,4. Bistability is one increasingly popular route towards achieving form or functional changes within a structure. One can group such structures by their applications in either energy-or motion-related fields 5. Impact absorption 3,6,7 is one energy-related field that has seen increased attention. Examples of motion-related applications may include robotic manipulators, active building facades, large scale space structures 2 and trapping mechanisms 8. From reviewed literature, complex activation is achieved through the tiling of multiple bistable units. With morphing, Schioler and Pellegrino 2 convert a static truss to an active one by replacing some of the members using bistable actuators. Utilising 3D printing, Restrepo et al. 3 and Shan et al. 7 connected multiple bistable mechanisms to form 2D energy absorbing blocks. Han et al. 9 proposed a quad-stable mechanism and commented on the parameters influencing the structure, in particular the rigidity of the frame constraining the buckling elements. In Oh and Kota 10 , a rotational quad-stable mechanism was proposed. It shows a hierarchical structure where the outer bistable mechanism uses the inner one as a pin. Oh and Kota also stated that by designing the mechanism in a single layer, it can be manufactured in one piece cost effectively. An attractive feature of bistability is that energy input is only needed to transform between states, but not to maintain them. Using a bistable mechanism is novel compared to others who use swelling or prestressing to achieve large magnitude activation. Mao et al. 11 utilise the shape-memory effect of thermal plastics to "lock-in" pre-stress, and achieve shape change through temperature variation. Raviv et al. 12 achieve large state changes through swelling of strategically printed hydrogels.},

Adaptation of conventional systems of control to soft devices requires hard valves and electronic controls. This paper describes completely soft pneumatic digital logic gates having a physical scale appropriate for use with current (macroscopic) soft actuators. Each digital logic gate utilizes a single bistable valve—the pneumatic equivalent of a Schmitt trigger—which relies on the snap-through instability of a hemispherical membrane to kink internal tubes and operates with binary high/low input and output pressures. Soft, pneumatic NOT, AND, and OR digital logic gates—which generate known pneumatic outputs as a function of one, or multiple, pneumatic inputs—allow fabrication of digital logic circuits for a set–reset latch, two-bit shift register, leading-edge detector, digital-to-analog converter (DAC), and toggle switch. The DAC and toggle switch, in turn, can control and power a soft actuator (demonstrated using a pneu-net gripper). These macroscale soft digital logic gates are scalable to high volumes of airflow, do not consume power at steady state, and can be reconfigured to achieve multiple functionalities from a single design (including configurations that receive inputs from the environment and from human users).

uncovered, where they constitute a transition map that is editable upon

the excitation conditions, reversible transitions between all stable

In this paper, a novel approach in performing AND and OR mechanical logic is successfully demonstrated. The proposed mechanical metamaterial controls the buckling response of a biased Von Mises Truss through actuation of anisotropic 3D unit cells to perform Boolean logic. It is shown, by changing the separation distance between unit cells, the functional material can behave as an AND/OR gate. Actuation of the unit cell changes the effective beam length of the bistable system, allowing a snap-through response to occur. By changing the orientation of the 3D unit cells, the input direction must also be considered for a snap-through response. The mechanical logic gates demonstrated are multi-plane, as the correct plane of actuation and input sequence are required for an output to occur.},

   abstract = {This study presents theoretical analysis and synthesis algorithm for multithreshold threshold gates (MTTGs) built of resonant tunnelling diodes (RTDs). The aim of the synthesis is to find a structure of an MTTG gate and relations between all the RTDs given an arbitrary Boolean function of n variables. The contribution of this study is 3-fold: first the authors formulate a functional model of the MTTG gate in which output is given as the difference of two min functions each taking weighed sums of input signals as arguments. Second, it is shown that any Boolean function can be represented as a min/max composition of hyperplanes (weighed sum of input signals) representing threshold functions. Later a procedure is proposed that transforms min/max composition to a difference of two min functions that corresponds to the MTTG structure. Finally, the authors show that the complexity of the resulting the MTTG gate depends on the number of thresholds k in the threshold decomposition of Boolean function and propose a dedicated threshold decomposition procedure that minimises the resulting number of thresholds. As a result, synthesised MTTG circuit is composed of at most (k + 1)(n + 1) RTD devices and (k + 1)n switching elements. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2013.},

   abstract = {A multi-threshold element is one in which several thresholds are used to separate the true inputs from the false inputs. Many circuit elements and configurations can be described by this model. An approach, based on conventional single-threshold threshold elements, is developed for the analysis and synthesis of multi-threshold threshold elements. It is shown that the basic properties of such elements are similar to conventional threshold elements, and that R-threshold threshold-element readability of an arbitrary n-variable Boolean function can be related to conventional threshold-element realizability of a related (n+k -)-variable Boolean function., Foundations for two basically different methods for the synthesis of a single-element realization of an arbitrary Boolean function are developed, as are procedures for transforming such a realization into both two-level and multilevel loop-free networks of R-threshold threshold elements k>l. Every element in the networks has the identical weight vector for the independent variables, which is sometimes desirable. The transformation technique is a useful approach to the synthesis of functions by networks of conventional threshold elements. It is proved that if the given function requires a R-threshold threshold element, then at least [k/2+I] conventional threshold elements in a two-level network or [l+log2 R] such elements in a multilevel network are required. Transformations are given for corresponding minimum-gate networks. Electronic-circuit realizations of multi-threshold elements and some logical-design applications of the multi-threshold approach to network design are discussed. The latter indicate that this approach can be easy to use and can result in economical realizations. Copyright © 1966 — The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc.},

   abstract = {In this paper, we have developed a solver based on the message-passing interface (MPI) to enable rapid large-scale simulation of generic metastructures composed of bi- or multi-stable elements. The in-house solver has been thoroughly validated against a commercial numerical solver (Abaqus) and the well-established serial codes from the previous studies. We can achieve up to 4th-order solution accuracy with fully explicit Runge-Kutta (RK) methods, exceeding what many commercial structural analysis tools provide. With our parallel code dedicated to solving specific problem types, the absolute computational speed can be improved by three orders of magnitude, enabling the investigation of a large parameter space. More importantly, the in-house implementation enables an effective distribution of the computational load following the intrinsic structural periodicity, thus achieving efficient parallel scalability. To demonstrate our code's capability to handle massively large problems previously unattainable with existing solvers, we investigate the amplitude-dependent energy transmissibility of bi-stable metabeams and the stability of the transition wave's propagation speed. The achieved numerical and computational performance gains drastically expand the accessible analysis domains of general nonlinear metamaterial and metastructure architectures, thus opening up the potential to uncover new dynamics and enable practical implementations.

The Newmark-β (implicit) method with constant average acceleration is also available if unconditional numerical stability is desired. Additional comments including restrictions and unusual features: Running NM̂3 requires installation of Python (with NumPy library), MPI, and HDF5. A Python script is used to generate input files. The code use MPI system calls to allow a massive parallelization among the compute processes. The code uses HDF5 file format for data storage.},

   abstract = {Driven by advances in materials and computer science, researchers are attempting to design systems where the computer and material are one and the same entity. Using theoretical and computational modeling, we design a hybrid material system that can autonomously transduce chemical, mechanical, and electrical energy to perform a computational task in a self-organized manner, without the need for external electrical power sources. Each unit in this system integrates a self-oscillating gel, which undergoes the Belousov-Zhabotinsky (BZ) reaction, with an overlaying piezoelectric (PZ) cantilever. The chemomechanical oscillations of the BZ gels deflect the PZ layer, which consequently generates a voltage across the material. When these BZ-PZ units are connected in series by electrical wires, the oscillations of these units become synchronized across the network, where the mode of synchronization depends on the polarity of the PZ. We show that the network of coupled, synchronizing BZ-PZ oscillators can perform pattern recognition. The “stored” patterns are set of polarities of the individual BZ-PZ units, and the “input” patterns are coded through the initial phase of the oscillations imposed on these units. The results of the modeling show that the input pattern closest to the stored pattern exhibits the fastest convergence time to stable synchronization behavior. In this way, networks of coupled BZ-PZ oscillators achieve pattern recognition. Further, we show that the convergence time to stable synchronization provides a robust measure of the degree of match between the input and stored patterns. Through these studies, we establish experimentally realizable design rules for creating “materials that compute.”},

   abstract = {Nonreciprocity can be passively achieved by harnessing material nonlinearities. In particular, networks of nonlinear bistable elements with asymmetric energy landscapes have recently been shown to support unidirectional transition waves. However, in these systems energy can be transferred only when the elements switch from the higher to the lower energy well, allowing for a one-time signal transmission. Here, we show that in a mechanical metamaterial comprising a 1D array of bistable arches nonreciprocity and reversibility can be independently programmed and are not mutually exclusive. By connecting shallow arches with symmetric energy wells and decreasing energy barriers, we design a reversible mechanical diode that can sustain multiple signal transmissions. Further, by alternating arches with symmetric and asymmetric energy landscapes we realize a nonreciprocal chain that enables propagation of different transition waves in opposite directions. This work presents a mechanical metamaterial with 1D array of bistable arches where nonreciprocity and reversibility can be independently programmed. The effects of asymmetry both at the structural and element level on propagation of transition waves are examined.},

To address this issue, we present a construction system for mechanical metamaterials based on discrete assembly of a finite set of parts, which can be spatially composed for a range of properties such as rigidity, compliance, chirality, and auxetic behavior. This system achieves desired continuum properties through design of the parts such that global behavior is governed by local mechanisms.

This approach benefits from incremental assembly, which eliminates scale limitations, best-practice manufacturing for reliable, low-cost part production, and interchangeability through a consistent assembly process across part types.},

   abstract = {The author describes two types of mechanical reversible logic which eliminate sliding contact. In the first type, contact between parts, when it does occur, involves only pressure. In the second, all contact between parts is eliminated. The entire computation could in principle be performed by a single block of complexly shaped oscillating material. The state of the computation is stored in the elastic deformations of this single block. If the material is perfectly elastic, the resulting computer will dissipate no energy. Real material moving sufficiently slowly can approximate a perfectly elastic material as closely as desired. In real materials, energy dissipation occurs during successive cycles of compression and decompression of the material much as energy dissipation occurs when a gas is compressed by a piston. However, at sufficiently low temperatures, this mechanism of energy dissipation might no longer be operative. It is not impossible that energy dissipation can be made to fall exponentially as both temperature and speed of operation are reduced.},

The buckled beams, which require very low actuation force and provide a sufficiently large contact force, are designed based on a parametric study. U-shaped thermal actuators are designed to provide the actuation force with minimum electrical power. The compact switch is fabricated using a simple single mask process on a SOI wafer. The average switching power is measured to be 60 mW, while the average switching delay is 350 μs. The power-delay product of about 20μ J is the lowest reported so far for bistable MEMS switches based on thermal actuation. The switch retains functionality even after 5 million switching cycles.

   abstract = {We introduce two essential building blocks with binary stiffness for mechanical digital machines. The large scale fully compliant mechanisms have rectilinear and rotational kinematics and use a new V-shaped negative stiffness structure to create two extreme states of stiffness by static balancing. The use of a mechanical bistable switch allows us to toggle between near-zero-stiffness and high-stiffness states, effectively turning off and on stiffness. A stiffness reduction of 98.8% and 99.9% is achieved for linear and rotary motion over a range of 13.3% (20mm) and 0.4rad (23∘) respectively. Stiffness states can be reversibly changed by toggling the mechanical switch, or irreversibly by actuating the main stage. These binary stiffness mechanisms could set the stage for a new type of mechanical logic, adaptive and programmable metamaterials and other types of digital mechanical devices. Practical mechanical digital machines and materials require miniaturized and easily micro-manufactured components. We have therefore carefully considered scalability by integrating all required structures into a planar and monolithic architecture. This allows miniaturization and fabrication with conventional surface-micro-machining and additive manufacturing such as photolithography, two-photon lithography and fused deposition modeling.},

A key benefit of our approach is that the resulting objects can be 3D printed in one piece and thus do not require assembly. We are building on 3D printed cell structures, also known as metamaterials. We introduce a new type of cell that propagates a digital mechanical signal using an embedded bistable spring. When triggered, the embedded spring discharges and the resulting impulse triggers one or more neighboring cells, resulting in signal propagation. We extend this basic mechanism to implement simple logic functions. We demonstrate interactive objects based on this concept, such as a combination lock. We present a custom editor that allows users to model 3D objects, route signals, simulate signal flow, and synthesize cell patterns.},

Although electronic computers became dominant in the past 60 years, recent advancements in three-dimensional micro-additive manufacturing technology provide new fabrication techniques for complex microstructures which have rekindled research interest in mechanical computations. Here we propose a new digital mechanical computation approach based on additively-manufacturable micro-mechanical logic gates. The proposed mechanical logic gates (i.e., NOT, AND, OR, NAND, and NOR gates) utilize multi-stable micro-flexures that buckle to perform Boolean computations based purely on mechanical forces and displacements with no electronic components. A key benefit of the proposed approach is that such systems can be additively fabricated as embedded parts of microarchitected metamaterials that are capable of interacting mechanically with their surrounding environment while processing and storing digital data internally without requiring electric power. Mechanical computing based on the logic devices that utilize mechanical energy can be an alternative to conventional electronic computing. Here, Song et al. show a micromechanical logic gate, fabricated using multi-stable buckling flexures, which is capable of realizing all digital logic operations.},

We show that the in-plane and out-of-plane Poisson's ratios are equal in magnitude, but opposite in sign, independent of material properties. Furthermore, we show that effective bending stiffness of the unit cell is singular, allowing us to characterize the two-dimensional deformation of a plate in terms of a one-dimensional theory. Finally, we solve the inverse design problem of determining the geometric parameters for the optimal geometric and mechanical response of these extreme structures. © 2013 American Physical Society.},

By virtue of their interactions, these mechanically stable lattice defects also lead to emergent crystallographic structures such as vacancies, dislocations, and grain boundaries. Each of these structures comes from an arrangement of reversible folds, highlighting a connection between mechanical metamaterials and programmable matter.

   abstract = {Metamaterials are designed to realize exotic physical properties through the geometric arrangement of their underlying structural layout1,2. Traditional mechanical metamaterials achieve functionalities such as a target Poisson’s ratio3 or shape transformation4–6 through unit-cell optimization7–9, often with spatial heterogeneity10–12. These functionalities are programmed into the layout of the metamaterial in a way that cannot be altered. Although recent efforts have produced means of tuning such properties post-fabrication13–19, they have not demonstrated mechanical reprogrammability analogous to that of digital devices, such as hard disk drives, in which each unit can be written to or read from in real time as required. Here we overcome this challenge by using a design framework for a tileable mechanical metamaterial with stable memory at the unit-cell level. Our design comprises an array of physical binary elements (m-bits), analogous to digital bits, with clearly delineated writing and reading phases. Each m-bit can be independently and reversibly switched between two stable states (acting as memory) using magnetic actuation to move between the equilibria of a bistable shell20–25. Under deformation, each state is associated with a distinctly different mechanical response that is fully elastic and can be reversibly cycled until the system is reprogrammed. Encoding a set of binary instructions onto the tiled array yields markedly different mechanical properties; specifically, the stiffness and strength can be made to range over an order of magnitude. We expect that the stable memory and on-demand reprogrammability of mechanical properties in this design paradigm will facilitate the development of advanced forms of mechanical metamaterials.},
